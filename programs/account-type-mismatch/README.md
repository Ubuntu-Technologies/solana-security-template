# Type Cosplay (Missing Discriminator)

**Vulnerability**: Passing account of type A where type B expected due to missing type identifier  
**Framework**: Pinocchio (no_std)  

## Overview

This program demonstrates the "Type Cosplay" vulnerability where accounts without discriminators can be confused for different types with similar memory layouts.

## The Vulnerability

Without a discriminator (type identifier byte), a program can't distinguish between different account types that share the same serialized layout. Attackers can pass a User account where an Admin account is expected.

```rust
// ❌ VULNERABLE: No type verification
struct User { pubkey: [u8; 32], balance: u64 }
struct Admin { pubkey: [u8; 32], permissions: u64 }
// Both are 40 bytes - indistinguishable!

// ✅ SECURE: Discriminator identifies type
struct User { discriminator: u8, pubkey: [u8; 32], balance: u64 }  // disc = 1
struct Admin { discriminator: u8, pubkey: [u8; 32], permissions: u64 } // disc = 2
```

## Attack Scenario

1. Attacker creates a User account with high "balance" value
2. Attacker passes User account to admin-only instruction
3. Program reads User.balance as Admin.permissions
4. Attacker gains unintended admin privileges

## Key Differences

### Vulnerable Version
```rust
pub fn process_action(program_id: &Address, accounts: &[AccountView]) -> ProgramResult {
    let data = account.try_borrow()?;
    
    // NO DISCRIMINATOR CHECK - BUG!
    // Reading bytes 1-32 as pubkey, assuming it's a User
    let user_pubkey = &data[0..32];
    // Could actually be an Admin account!
    Ok(())
}
```

### Secure Version
```rust
pub fn process_action(program_id: &Address, accounts: &[AccountView]) -> ProgramResult {
    let data = account.try_borrow()?;
    
    // CHECK DISCRIMINATOR FIRST
    if data[0] != USER_DISCRIMINATOR {
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
    }
    
    let user_pubkey = &data[1..33];  // Skip discriminator
    Ok(())
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test -p account-type-mismatch-tests
```

## Mitigation Checklist

- [ ] Add discriminator as first byte of all account types
- [ ] Always verify discriminator before deserializing
- [ ] In Anchor, use `#[account]` macro which adds 8-byte discriminator
- [ ] Use unique discriminator values for each account type
- [ ] Consider using enums for type safety
