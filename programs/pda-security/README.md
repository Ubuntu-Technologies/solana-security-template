# Weak PDA Seeds

**Vulnerability**: Predictable or weak seeds allowing PDA collision/front-running  
**Framework**: Anchor  

## Overview

This program demonstrates vulnerabilities related to weak PDA seed construction, including predictable seeds and insufficient uniqueness that enables front-running or collision attacks.

## The Vulnerability

PDAs are derived deterministically from seeds. If seeds are predictable or insufficient, attackers can:
1. Front-run account creation
2. Create colliding PDAs  
3. Impersonate or hijack user accounts

```rust
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Only user pubkey - predictable, no uniqueness
seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref()]

// ✅ SECURE: Includes random nonce for uniqueness
seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref(), &nonce.to_le_bytes()]
```

## Attack Scenario

1. Attacker monitors pending transactions
2. Before victim's `create_user` confirms, attacker computes same PDA
3. Attacker front-runs with their own transaction
4. Victim's transaction fails (account already exists) or worse, uses attacker's account

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib.rs` | Program entry points |

| `vulnerable.rs` | ❌ Weak seeds (user pubkey only) |
| `secure.rs` | ✅ Strong seeds (includes nonce) |
| `error.rs` | Custom error types |

## Key Differences

### Vulnerable Version
```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = user,
    space = 8 + 32 + 8,
    // WEAK: Any observer can compute this PDA
    seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump
)]
pub user_account: Account<'info, UserAccount>,
```

### Secure Version
```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = user,
    space = 8 + 32 + 8 + 8,
    // STRONG: Includes random nonce
    seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref(), &nonce.to_le_bytes()],
    bump
)]
pub user_account: Account<'info, UserAccountSecure>,
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test -p pda-seeds-tests
```

## Mitigation Checklist

- [ ] Include user-controlled random nonce in seeds
- [ ] Use Anchor's canonical bump handling (`bump` constraint)
- [ ] Never store user-provided bump - derive fresh each time
- [ ] For global config, use program authority as seed
- [ ] Document seed structure for each PDA type
